# Discussion

As a user, I would like to use my Medical Recommendation and Government Issued Id for ordering online. I would also like to be able to replace or delete my Medical Recommendation and Id.

# Requirements

* Create a service that stores users, medical recommendations, and id's.
* Store users' name, email, and dob.
* Store the medical recommendation number, issuer, state, expiration date, and path to the image.
* Store the id number, state, expiration date, and path to the image.
* This service should allow a user to upload, update, and delete medical recommendation and id data.
* If the medical recommendation or id is expired, return expired.

# Notes
* We review the code challenges anonymously. Try not to include any identifying information in your commits.
* Use your normal development practices and git workflow, as if this were a production app. Please push any intermediate commits when you complete them.
* To make it easier for us to find the code that you're writing, please try not to mix commits with generated code and code you've written yourself.
* We have not installed any test frameworks and leave that to you to implement however you see fit.
* In the initial commit message, include an estimate of how long you think it will take to complete the exercise (not including the bonus tasks). For example: `Initial commit - estimating x hours`
* In the final commit message, include how long it took to complete the exercise. For example: `Make sure foo works properly - completed in y hours`
* We would like to focus on reviewing your application logic, so please be mindful and keep your commit history as clean as possible.

# Confirmation
* API endpoint that returns a user, medical recommendation, and id.
* If the medical recommendation or id are expired return expired.
* Ability to delete or update medical recommendation and id.
* Create a dev branch and create a pull request to master.
